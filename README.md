### Bootcamp 2020 Project 4A: Red Queen's Race with Web Animation API

Review the [code and demo](https://codepen.io/rachelnabors/pen/PNGGaV) and improve and build your own Red Queens Race Animation.

Note the following:

1. When Alice drinks from the bottle, she grows smaller. 
2. Because small children tire out easily, unlike automaton chess pieces, Alice is constantly slowing down.
3. But urging them on by clicking or tapping causes them to speed up.
4. The background elements also have playback rates that are impacted when you click or tap.

### Bootcamp 2020 Project 5: Build a Animated React Website which follows the Latest Trends like Animated Illustrations

"Our eyes are hardwired to notice movement. Historically, it’s helped to keep us alive. And, in 2020, web designers are capitalizing on this default human setting.
Animated illustrations are one of the newest trends being used to direct viewer attention within web designs.  You’ll see these petite animations on sites all over the web.
Some animated illustrations are merely still graphics that jiggle, while other illustrated animations are more thoughtful and complex. When used to their fullest capacity, animated illustrations can tell stories, explain concepts, or help viewers navigate a website."

[20 Extraordinary Web Design Ideas That Will Get Everyone Clicking](https://www.jeffbullas.com/web-design-ideas/)
Incorporating illustration on a website has been a trend for a few years. However, designers are now focusing to create custom and 3D illustrations to define a brand.
An illustration can empower a brand if blended well with minimalism. See how the brand Neat has rightly executed this trend:

[Neat Website](https://thisisneat.com.au/)

To intrigue viewers, brands like Pitch have introduced 3D illustration design:

In this project you will build a animated React Website, all animations must use the latest Web Animations API and latest trends.

Please note if I am leading a team two things are not tolerated under any circumstances: telling an untruth and unprofessional behavior. I do not care if you are not super-intelligent but what we are looking for are people who take ownership and are highly ethical and professional.
