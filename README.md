More Details will added as we go forward.

### Get AWS and Google Cloud Accounts for Bootcamp 2020
The software industry has completely shifted toward multi-cloud usage in projects. In our bootcamp we will be using Amazon and Google clouds extensively. It is requested from all participants that they make arrangements to get the following free AWS and Google accounts within one month:

[AWS Free Offer](https://aws.amazon.com/free/)

[Google Cloud Free Offer](https://cloud.google.com/free)

Note 1: It is very easy the difficult part is getting your account verified by using credit cards or bank accounts. 

Note 2: The cloud accounts are not required immediately. We will need them in about a months time.

### Bootcamp 2020 Ninja Team Selection
I will be selecting the best of the best developers from the bootcampers to work closely me and our team. First they will help the students and later they will be doing freelancing with our team. The criteria for selection will be the submitted projects, professionalism and project ownership. Even once selected you can be removed from the team because you did not follow instructions, or your performance is not up to mark. Only one warning will be given before removal. 

Right now I have selected only nine developer:

1. Jazzel Mehmood, Karachi
2. Farhan Farooq, Karachi
3. Abdul Raffay Rizwan, Karachi
4. Nadir Ali, Karachi
5. Maleeha Khalid, Lahore
6. Muhammad Usman Tariq, Karachi
7. Muhammad Bilal, Rawalpindi
8. Muhammad Usman, Wah Cantt 
9. Saad Baig, Karachi

Muhammad Naeem Akhtar from Turin, Italy and Nadir Ali from Karachi have jointly won Chief Ninja position in Bootcamp 2020
I am extremely pleased to announce that Muhammad Naeem Akhtar ( https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100014148211403 ) and Nadir Ali ( https://www.facebook.com/nadirali.abro.58/ ) have won the Chief Ninja position by submitting the following two React apps:

Interesting info about Naeem:
Right now he is living in Turin, Italy. He has done Bachelor in Electronic Engineering and Master in Mechatronic Engineering from Italy. Right now he is doing a full time job as Junior Java and IoT developer. 

Note for everyone: All positions are temporary, as we move forward anyone can replace anyone, everything is purely merit based. 


Please note if I am leading a team two things are not tolerated under any circumstances: telling an untruth and unprofessional behavior. I do not care if you are not super-intelligent but what we are looking for are people who take ownership and are highly ethical and professional.
