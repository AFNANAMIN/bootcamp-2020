### Get AWS and Google Cloud Accounts for Bootcamp 2020
The software industry has completely shifted toward multi-cloud usage in projects. In our bootcamp we will be using Amazon and Google clouds extensively. It is requested from all participants that they make arrangements to get the following free AWS and Google accounts within one month:

https://aws.amazon.com/free/

https://cloud.google.com/free

Note 1: It is very easy the difficult part is getting your account verified by using credit cards or bank accounts. 

Note 2: The cloud accounts are not required immediately. We will need them in about a months time.
